          <p>Saber (セイバー, Seibā?), Knight of the Sword (剣の騎士?) and Heroic Spirit of the Sword (剣士の英霊?), is one of the Three Knight Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War.<br />Servants placed within this class are agile and powerful melee warriors adept at swordsmanship, boasting high ratings in all categories, and they are often heroes from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace. The qualifying conditions require the Heroic Spirits to have legends as knights of the sword, and it is the class that requires the highest levels of attributes in all but the Magic attribute.It is possible for the status qualifications to be bypassed in special circumstances, such as through Nero Claudius Caesar's Imperial Privilege. Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Noble Phantasm Sword Hunt qualifies him as an extremely rare Saber without qualities distinctive of the class. Compatible Heroic Spirits usually excel in delivering powerful burst attacks. <br /> The standard opinion is that the Saber Class is the best of the seven classes and the strongest of the Servants, said to have made it to the final battle in the first four Fuyuki wars.They will generally have an overwhelming advantage over Caster-class Servants who uses magecraft as their main offensive ability due to their Magic Resistance Skill.The weakness of the class is its straightforwardness in battle, only able to attack the enemy with their sword while unable to resort to other tactics like the Presence Concealment of the Assassin Class.The Class Skills of the Saber class are Magic Resistance and Riding.

        <p>Archer (アーチャー, Āchā?), Knight of the Bow and Heroic Spirit of the Bow (弓兵の英霊?), is one of the Three Knight Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class excel in possessing powerful Noble Phantasms, are able to act as highly effective scouts, and are frequently Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace.<br />The qualifying condition for the Heroic Spirits is not attributes, but instead the possession of powerful projectile weapons or special abilities related to projectile weapons. They possess high Magic Resistance as a Class Skill, so most modern magi are unable to inflict damage to them. They also possess Independent Action, allowing them the ability to act independently for a length of time without an active supply of magical energy from their Master.<br />Due to excelling in powerful Noble Phantasms, Tokiomi Tohsaka considers it inevitable that Gilgamesh, with his EX ranked Ea, came to be of this class. For Archers with high ranked Independent Action and a disposition opposite to the Master, the only guaranteed way to control them is through the use of Command Spells.Servants will generally assume that the Noble Phantasm of an Archer-class Servant is their bow, but any projectile weapons, even firearms, can be indicative of an Archer.

Their only particular class ability is Magic Resistance, and although they "tend to be less flashy than the other classes", they display great reliability.

Masters eventually began adding additional lines to the summoning incantations and bringing catalysts not associated with Hassan to call upon different Heroic Spirits.Within other systems, there is no limit on the summoning of other Heroic Spirits.
          <br />For the Hassan-i-Sabbah, they lack glamorous legends, so they are known to possess low attributes. Their very lifeline in battle is reliance on Presence Concealment.

Servants placed within this Class are those known for riding mounts, whether living beasts or human constructs, during their lives.<br />There are even some cases where legendary animals have been summoned as a Servant such as Vánagandr and Red Hare. They generally have lower attributes compared to the Three Knight Classes, but the abilities of the mounts described in their legends compensate by granting them powerful Noble Phantasms or abilities.<br />They have the class abilities of Magic Resistance and a high rank in Riding, allowing them to fully utilize the abilities of their mounts. Depending on the rank, they can take full control of everything from simple horses, modern machinery like motorcycles and planes, and even Divine Beasts. Dragons are the only exception as the ability to ride them falls under a different Skill; however, rare exceptions do occur.

Due to not requiring any strong statistics, they generally have low combat abilities, and due to the majority of Servants having some form of Magic Resistance, this Class is thought to be the weakest of all seven.They make up for this with other means, using magecraft that no longer exists in the current age and, no matter which Heroic Spirit is of which Class, possessing many possible ploys to be used against enemies. Those of the Saber Class can likely challenge any Caster who uses magecraft as their main offensive ability without needing to plan due to their high Magic Resistance, while those of lesser resistance like the Rider Class may require more strategy.
          <br> Their class abilities are Territory Creation, altering the surrounding lands in favor of their sorcery, and Item Construction, which allows the magus to create magical items and tools.

        <p>Berserker (バーサーカー, Bāsākā), Mad Warrior and Heroic Spirit of Berserk Rage (狂戦士の英霊), is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are always Heroic Spirits who have gone berserk during battle at least once in their lifetime. This trait allows them to use the special ability Mad Enhancement, which trades their consciousness and sanity for a large power boost. This Class is usually for magi who have summoned Heroic Spirits with insufficient abilities and attributes, allowing them to strengthen their Servants to make up for their lower attributes and compete against stronger opponents. While it is ideal for Servants to reach the level of the Heroic Spirit, the Class allows for their attributes to surpass even the original. If used on an already strong Heroic Spirit, such as Heracles, they will become empowered to truly extraordinary levels. The abuse of this to create powerful Servants has made the Class referred to as the strongest of all seven classes.
          <br>It is possible to specify in the summoning ritual that the Servant be placed under the Berserker Class for those familiar with the workings of the Grail System. By adding in a specific line, Zouken Matou and the Einzbern family, as members of the Three Founding Families, were able to choose the Class during the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars respectively. This Class comes at a price, as the Berserker Class is the most difficult to control and a Master must expend a large amount of additional magical energy merely to maintain the Berserker, and the affected Heroic Spirit may lose access to certain abilities or even Noble Phantasms depending on how much sanity it has taken away for power.<br>Masters are unable to utilize coordination with their Servant unless gifted with superb control over them. The lack of complex rational thinking keeps them from being able to follow more than simple directions, and it may even require Command Spells to keep them from acting on their own. They generally rely on little other than brute strength and overwhelming, uncontrolled strikes to physically beat down their opponents. As a result, in every Holy Grail War before the Fifth, the magical energy consumption and insanity of the Berserker Class has made them incredibly difficult to maintain and control. Kariya Matou is drained of his energy at a high rate and eventually it causes his death, but he could have handled another Class without difficulty. They have generally brought about their own Master's ruin due to their inability to control them, so the Einzbern family developed Ilyasviel's Magic Circuits specifically so that she could handle the strain with ease in the Fifth Holy Grail War.

      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <p>Fate/Grand Order is a turn-based tactical RPG.The player takes the role of "Master" and commands a group of individuals called "Servants", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological figures from various cultures. The player commands a party composed of up to 6 Servants in each battle, 3 active members and 3 reserve members.</p>
      <img src="image/howtoplay-images/party-setup.jpg" class="img-fluid w-100 mb-3">
      <p>In each turn, the player is given a set of 5 Command Cards and may use up to 3 of them in a turn to attack. Each Servant has 5 cards the player may use; the cards for all the Servants on the field are shuffled and dealt to the player each turn. The cards have three types: Buster (a heavy attack), Arts (a medium attack that charges a gauge for the Servant's "Noble Phantasm"), and Quick (a light attack that generates Critical Stars that increase the probability of critical hits next turn).</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>If three similar cards are used in one turn, they create a "Chain" which gives a bonus based on the cards' properties. If three cards all corresponding to the same servant are selected, then a "Brave Chain" will ensue, resulting in an extra, more powerful, attack being added onto the end. Each Servant also has skills that can be used before drawing Command Cards; each skill gives effects in the battle, as well as a special command card called "Noble Phantasm" that appears when the gauge is full. The "Master" also has a separate set of skills and special abilities called "Command Spells." Command Spells have a variety of effects and recharge based on real-world time.</p>

      <p>Servants are obtained via a gacha mechanic. Saint Quartz, an in-game currency earned both by playing the game and via real money in-app purchases, is used to summon new Servants and acquire "Craft Essences" which give additional effects when equipped to a servant. This summoning is random, with some servants available commonly, and others rarely. Another currency is "Friend Points", which are more easily acquired, but only can acquire common Servants with them. If multiple copies of the same Servant are acquired, that servant's power is slightly increased.</p>
